title: Our Businesses | Deployment Ready
description: >
  There is a wide range of commercial opportunities that we are addressing
  across many industries through our Joint Venture, and these commercial
  opportunities are the means by which we are incorporating and deploying our
  dynamic Quantum technologies in the province of KwaZulu Natal.


  Although our primary focus involves the communities inhabited by the millions
  of residents of KwaZulu Natal, the economic and commercial impacts of our
  business activities are felt across South Africa with even broader positive
  implications for the African continent and even internationally. This is
  because our businesses are focused on producing new goods and services, and
  improving the existing goods and services already produced in these
  communities.


  By expanding and improving these local economies through our value-added
  technologies, we empower these communities to develop stronger commercial ties
  across South Africa, broaden trading relationships across the sub-Saharan
  region, positively contribute to the ongoing transformation of the economies
  of the African continent, and deepen the international trade ties that reward
  the export sector.


  Some of our companies’ deployment-ready solutions and their business
  activities include the following:

  - title: Q-Power
    description: >-
      Our Q-Power initiative will contribute to the Kingdom’s sustainability by
      providing renewable energy resources based on proprietary technologies
      derived from our diverse commercial sector experience, research, and
      academia. These proprietary technologies will foster energy independence
      through optimally engineered solutions that exceed the most demanding
      standards of the renewable energy sector.

  - title: B.E.S.T. Joint Venture
    description: >
      Quantum Age Corporation and Biomass Energy Sustainable Technologies
      (B.E.S.T.) have structured a Joint Venture agreement to harvest invasive
      species of wood within the Ingonyama region. These woods will be exported
      under existing B.E.S.T. offtake agreements and will increase the supply of
      woods chips for energy generation in South Africa. Additionally, this will
      result in the increased beneficiation of wood chips and wood-related
      products, resulting in more value-added products.


      QZULU will provide technology to the partnerships and oversee its
      integration into B.E.S.T.’s and NUPOWER offerings and manage deployment.
      The technologies include:


      -   Trees that are carbon neutral and do not produce carbon even when
      burned – specially developed for woodchips


      -  Woodchips processing technique that ensures more biomass and higher
      energy


      -  Trees that grow rapidly and are disease resistant and uptake minimum
      water


      -  Flash charge battery solution for e-vehicles that dramatically reduce
      time it takes to charge a battery creating parity with fossil fuel
      vehicles in terms of fueling time and eliminates distance anxiety 


      -  Flash charge solutions that can be deployed for fleet electrification 


      -  Graphene enabled solar panel with 25 - 30% higher efficiency 


      -  Organic battery storage solution for single home or community –
      non-hazardous, non-flammable batteries without lithium, cobalt or lead.

  - title: QFarms
    description: >
      Our Q-Farms initiative will empower more than 25,000 individual farmers
      across the Kingdom of Zululand by incorporating state-of-the-art farming
      technologies, resulting in new agricultural opportunities and enhanced
      farming skills. This will allow local farmers to play a more prominent
      role in the Quantum marketplace.


      QZULU will provide to the partnership its technology for precision farming
      and Bio-flocculation via QAC. It will also oversee its integration into
      the farming practices to develop disease-resistant, better-tasting and
      more nutritious crop harvests and for beneficiation of the woodchips. 


      The technologies planned for the deployment include:


      -  Nutrients (organic – non-chemical customized recipes for the plant
      types) injected directly into the roots which also protect the plants from
      exposure to bugs and

      diseases.


      -  Technology to make or increase dry, barren lands fertile with a
      propitiatory mix of nutrients and organic fertilizers


      -  Developing seeds that will produce robust, healthy crops that are
      disease resistant

      and more resilient, producing safe and chemical free non-GMO vegetables
      and fruits.


      -  Mechanical products for agriculture which require very low-energy,
      frictionless

      pumps to deploy water that is filtered and pumped in precise quantities
      resulting in plants growing three times faster.

  - title: Q-Life© - High Performance Multipurpose App
    description: >
      As we roll out different projects and technologies, investors partners and
      customers will be able to monitor, participate in project activities, use
      the various applications and track progress and outcomes using a
      centralized app called Q-Life© which will be available on IOS and Android
      Platforms in the near future.


      Q-Life is a state-of-the-art Ai powered “Farms-to-Kitchens” platform,
      setting a new standard in rural market, finance, trade, mobility and

  - title: STRATEGIC ALLIANCE – RSE College
    image: /img/our_value_img_4.jpg
    description: >
      In addition to business alliances for technology deployment and revenue
      generation we have also formed very deep alliance with an entity that is
      dedicated to the future of the region. RSE College, a fully accredited
      private college in South Africa, registered with

      the Department of Higher education. 


      RSE delivers dynamic, pioneering new world education on a state-of-the-art
      technology platform. They offer full qualifications, skills programs and
      short courses across a variety of sectors. The students receive top
      quality education, fully accredited qualifications and assistance to
      navigate themselves in a world of employment where opportunities change
      constantly.


      For QZULU this is an opportunity to fulfil a large element of our
      corporate social responsibility by offering the young students an
      opportunity to learn about the emerging technologies, position for future
      jobs and open the minds of the next generation of business executives,
      engineers and scientists. An opportunity to shoulder the future through
      internships, work study programs and other mutually beneficial models.
      Partnering with RSE College, QZULU is implementing capacity building and
      training program to prepare* a skilled workforce that can be effective
      locally and globally.


      To further support RSE Students, Amaris AI, a fully owned subsidiary of
      QAC, with expertise in artificial intelligence and cyber security has
      developed a first of its kind AI enabled E-Learning engine which will be
      deployed for the first time through RSE College
