    There are many abiding principles, that govern our approach and activities
    to catalyze positive economic transformation through Quantum Kingdom of
    Zululand:
  valuesList:
    - title: POSITIVE ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION
      text: >-
        The introduction of advanced quantum technologies that do no currently
        exist in the Ingonyama region of South Africa provide us with the
        opportunity to dynamically contribute to the economic landscape in the
        province of KwaZulu Natal. New industries will evolve from these
        technologies, and existing technologies will be rendered more modern and
        adaptable.
    - title: "\_EMPLOYMENT CREATION"
      text: >-
        More than twelve million people reside in the region that has
        historically and traditionally been associated with the Kingdom of
        Zululand. The creation of additional jobs in existing industries and
        companies is of great importance, as is the stimulation of employment
        opportunities in emerging industries and companies related to our
        dynamism.
    - title: CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
      text: >-
        As a contributor to the economic vitality of the region, it is incumbent
        upon our Joint Venture to follow best international practices related to
        sustainability and social accountability. This relates to the
        communities we serve, our employees, other stakeholders, commercial
        counterparties, the Kingdom of Zululand, and the local, provincial, and
        national government.
    - title: ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP
      text: >-
        The negative impact that many industries across the global has had on
        the environment leaves much to be desired due to the degradation of
        land, pollution in the atmosphere, and the spoiling of waterways. It is
        our ethical, social, and moral responsibility to always be positive
        economic stewards of the environment, and to contribute to the
        sustainability of the lands and communities we positively impact.
