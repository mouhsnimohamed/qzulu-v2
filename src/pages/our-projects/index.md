introduction: "In addition to the deployment-ready solutions that our businesses are ready to implement now, there are a variety of exciting technologies and advanced solutions being developed for future deployment across a spectrum of industries.\n\_\nThese technologies and solutions have evolved from other technologies and solutions that our teams have developed over the past decades, both in the private and public sectors. The future deployment of these advanced technologies and solutions will achieve many objectives, including the establishment of the Ingonyama region as an example of advanced digital enablement and success.\n\_\nThese enhanced solutions will support existing commercial enterprises across KwaZulu Natal, and position the Kingdom of Zululand to become recognized as a regional and continental leader. These technologies will expand and strengthen the types of services that will be introduced and rolled out across the banking, payments, and financial services industries in sub-Saharan African."
